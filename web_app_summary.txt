Summary

1.  Setup & Models: Installed Django, created a project, added an app, defined models, 
    ran migrations, and used the admin site and Django shell to manage data.

2.  URLs, Views & Templates: Created URLs, view functions, and templates, 
    using template inheritance for consistency.

3.  Forms & User Accounts: Built forms so users could add/edit topics and entries. 
    Implemented authentication with login, logout, and registration using UserCreationForm. 
    Restricted access with @login_required, assigned data to users via foreign keys, 
    and ensured users only see their own data with filters.
    Styling: Applied Bootstrap with django-bootstrap5 for a professional, consistent look across devices.
     Used components like Navbar and Jumbotron to style pages.

4.  Deployment: Deployed the project to Platform.sh using Git. 
    Secured the live app with DEBUG = False and custom error pages.
